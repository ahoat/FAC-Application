        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi there and thank you for visiting my application to the next FAC cohort.
            <br>I am Ahoa (ah-ho-ah).  Born in Hong Kong and raised in London, I am an aspiring software developer.

            I am qualified accountant (ACCA) by trade and have held various roles within finance and accounting 
            ranging from Junior Accountant to Financial Controller.  The great thing about being an accountant is that 
            it is a skill and knowledge that all companies need, which is also true of software development.  Being an accountant
            has given me the opportunity to work in a diverse range of industries such as advertising, travel, property, food manufacturing to name a few.
            <br>After nearly 20 years, parts of the job no longer resonate or motivate me and I have no desire to move up to more senior roles 
            which is why I am looking to change things up and pursue something that I have always wanted to do.....coding!
            <br>Switching careers is scary.  Especially as I am not only accountable to myself but my family also.  However, I have thought long and hard about taking the dive into a career switch but ultimately 
            I decided that if I didn't pursue it, I will always be thinking about it so why not take the leap and see where I land.

        <h3>Why Coding?</h3>
        <p>
            My first experience of coding was back in college.  Back then, I was learning a programming language called
            Pascal.  The only syntax I can remember from that was "writeLn" which is similar to the p tag in HTML.
            I can't actually remember what my final project was about but I do remember being amazed at how something I had 
            written would magically appear and do things on the screen.
            To submit our projects for assessment, we had to print out all of our code on a "dot matrix printer".
            For those not old enough to remember, this is what a dot matrix printer looks like:
            <!--  Insert image of Dot Matrix Printer-->
            <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RFTC841cLCg/VgYmYZXV-tI/AAAAAAAAAJU/Rkz2OxLUFU8/s1600/DotMatrixPrinter.jpg" alt="picture of a   dot matrix printer">
            <br>
            
            We only had 1 of these in our college and if the paper got jammed, we would have to start the print run all 
            over again.  As you can imagine, the queue to use this printer was quite long and it was necessary to watch it print
            out each pixel at a time in case the paper feed got jammed.

            Fast forward to today, I wish I had pursued coding and computing.  Instead of thinking 'what if?', I have decided 
            that now is the right time to start.
            <br>
            So, back to the question, why coding? <br>
            Technology shapes so much of our modern life and how we interact with each other and the world that I feel 
            it's a skill that everyone should learn.  I see coding as a life skill that I want my children to learn and master.
            My kid's school doesn't currently offer a coding after school club but I hope one day I will be good enough at 
            coding to be able to teach change that.
            Coding is such a powerful tool for change, self-expression and creativity that I want to become a creator, not just a
            consumer.
            Don't tell my boss, but on a daily basis, my mind drifts to finding solutions for coding problems I have encountered 
            and I that is how I know I want to do this for a career.

        <h3>Why FAC?</h3>
        <p>
            I first heard of FAC from an old friend who encouraged me to look into it.  I am so glad I did!
            I really like their mission to diversify the talent pool within the tech community.

            The proudest moments of my career so far is mentoring my colleagues in achieving their accountancy qualifications.
            I celebrated their success so much more than my own, knowing the massive weight it lifts off their shoulders.
            Those moments showed me that anybody can learn anything and I am still a strong believer of that today.
            I really like that current FAC cohorts and alumni are acrively involved in mentoring newbies like myself and really hope that
            I can Pay it Forward (Great movie!) one day.
